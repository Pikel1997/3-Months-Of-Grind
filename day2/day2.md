# Day 2

Woah day 2 was intense, lots of code. I didn't expect to read up on Bootstrap classes and had to implement tons of them and WOW I HATE BOOTSTRAP, but hey it gets the job done.

## Notes

Very rough, prolly only useful to me.
- Dynamic content rendering by making a list of dictionaries.
- Python in html files using code blocks.
- Template Inheritance- setting up a static layout template but can dynamically change body content.
- Bootstrap classes pog but annoying.
- Defining route methods.
- Learned how to create forms using wtforms.
- Validated said forms.
