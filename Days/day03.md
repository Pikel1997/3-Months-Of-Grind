# Day 3

Day 3 was a tiresome day, went through 3 hours worth of tutorials and got 3 main things done:-
- Restructred files into a package.
- Set up authentication.
- Set up database and database connectivity.
Implemented tons of functionality like the ability to actually log in, log out and even password hashing, Also got the secret stored safely in a .env file, this was not smooth and I accidentally commited and pushed my token to git and github.
Don't worry though, I changed it and this time carefully set up the .gitignore file to ignore .env file.

## Notes

Very rough, prolly only useful to me.

- Restructred files into a package.
- Set up authentication.
- Set up database and database connectivity.

- Logout feature implementation was ezpz.
