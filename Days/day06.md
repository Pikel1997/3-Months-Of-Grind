# Day 6

Day 6 was a doozy, got into an accident and I'm okay if you're wondering, got patched up at a hospital and back at home grinding. I'm in no shape to make update videos but the repo will be updated daily.
So got very less work done but it's work done nonetheless, the main feature added today was - Password reset
Learned how to set up a [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol#:~:text=The%20Simple%20Mail%20Transfer%20Protocol,send%20and%20receive%20mail%20messages.)

And thats all.

## Notes

Very rough, prolly only useful to me.

- Created request password route
- Created reset password route
- Learned about [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and JWS
- Used [itsdanerous library](https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)
- Figured out an [alternative](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for depreceated itsdangerous functions
- Completed reset password functionality
