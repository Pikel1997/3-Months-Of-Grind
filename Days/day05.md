# Day 5

LMAO day 5 was not very grindy of me, I just did 3 things:-

- Pagination Functionality
- The ability to look up specific user posts
- Ordered all posts in descending order(latest to earliest)

Come on guys cut me some slack it was the weekend, bruh the following video will just be 1 minute long lmaooooo :sob: :sob: :sob:

## Notes

Very rough, prolly only useful to me.

- Pagination Functionality
- The ability to look up specific user posts
- Ordered all posts in descending order(latest to earliest)
- Limited number of page index
- Created user_posts route
- That's all but im adding this so it seems longer :sob:
