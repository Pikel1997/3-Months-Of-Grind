# Day 4

Day 4 was by far the most fun day, added tons of functionality and the web application finally has structure. It seems like all the hardwork I put in is bearing its fruit in terms of fully functional website.
 
There are more things to implement, but I'm impressed by my progress so far, the reason I found the work that I did today enjoyable is because I worked in a professional environment, used a proper desk and an ergonomic chair(back felt comfortable for once).

It seems like im getting lazy with the daily descriptions, hopefully the following days are more eventful so my descriptions sound technical and complex (laughing emoji- :laughing:)
