# 3-Months-Of-Grind

3-Months-Of-Grind is exactly what it sounds like 3 MONTHS OF GRIND, I will be documenting my journey as I learn flask, django and fastAPI

## Installation

### Create Virtual Environment

In a terminal run the following commands from the root folder of the forked project.

Windows

```bash
  python -m venv .\venv
```

Now that you are working in the virtualenv, install the project dependencies with the following command.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can preview your work by running flask run in the root of your fork and then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

```bash
  flask run
```
